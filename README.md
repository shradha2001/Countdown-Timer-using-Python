# Countdown-Timer-using-Python
This program focuses on creating a GUI using the Tkinter library. We will then create functions to allow users to set a countdown time.
# Description
* Create a separate folder 'CountDown'; and declare a python file.
* Declare the lists of hours and minutes.
* All the Tkinter widgets (Labels, Buttons, Combo boxes, etc) were declared.
* When the Reset Button is pressed, this function gets a call. It stops the program and destroys the GUI window.
* When the Set Button is pressed, Get_Time() function takes the time set by the user. If the users try to set the default value(0:0:0, see the yellow line), the program will show a warning message on the screen to choose a countable time.
* After pressing the  Button, the  and Pause buttons appear on the right side that allows the users to Start (or Resume) and Pause the time as their need.
# Features
